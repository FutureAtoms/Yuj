# Yuj

**Where ancient wisdom meets modern strength.**

## Vision

Yuj (युज्, Sanskrit for "to yoke" or "to unite") is envisioned as a premium mobile application that harmoniously blends the introspective practices of yoga and meditation with the dynamic discipline of modern weight training and lifting. 

We aim to provide a holistic approach to health and fitness, guiding users towards a balanced integration of mind, body, and spirit through structured workout programs, mindful movement guidance, and meditative practices tailored for the modern athlete.

## Features (Planned)

*   Personalized training programs combining strength, flexibility, and mindfulness.
*   Guided yoga flows and meditation sessions designed to complement weight training.
*   Progress tracking for both physical lifts and mindful practice consistency.
*   Expert content on biomechanics, mindful lifting techniques, and recovery strategies.
*   A clean, intuitive, and motivating user experience focused on sustainable well-being.
